In this project I design, build, and host a new website for an online Magic the Gathering community and eliminate the expensive costs from their last Wix website.

This version of the site is my first real project using React. The site is responsive and creates article pages from a json file. You can filter articles by their tags.

Things I'd like to come back and improve:
  - Make the images load faster when the page is rendered
  - Come up with a more intuitive article filter interface
  - Create an application I can use that will convert plain article text into json data of the article with html tags
