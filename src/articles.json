      "<p>Effective September 1, <a href=\"https://scryfall.com/card/plist/109/oubliette\" target=\"_blank\">Oubliette</a> will no longer be legal in Pauper Duel Commander. (This does not affect multiplayer PDH.)</p> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/9/6/96ccfecd-0dab-426a-8897-86c73934d21d.jpg?1599764501\" alt=\"Oubliette\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>Have you ever watched a bully and had to grit your teeth, hoping they get a taste of their own medicine? Well, Oubliette, this is how it feels!</p> <p>Over the past month the PDC RC have met to review the state of the format. Following the forming of the Pauper Duel Commander Rules Committee earlier this year, there has been a lot of discussion, and overall we are happy with where the format is heading.</p> <h2>So Why Ban Oubliette?</h2> <p>Oubliette is a relic of MTG's first-ever expansion, coming in long before they worked it all out. Its wording has been problematic since day one *, its abilities sit outside the modern \"<a href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/mechanical-color-pie-2021-10-18\" target=\"_blank\">Color Pie</a>\", and some have said its unique ability flies in the face of the 'Spirit of Commander'.</p> <p>As an RC, our priority for the format is growth. So if a card threatens that growth, or if it's creating feel-bads, it goes on the watch-list. Of course these are subjective reasons, but they're not the only ones:</p> <div class=\"indent\"> <ol> <li>Oubliette is the only card which can completely lock a commander out of the Command Zone. It was not designed with this in mind, and is uniquely powerful as a result.</li> <li>Unlike similar effects (<a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/5/1/51765d87-e842-4d84-aaf0-998737fe754c.jpg?1562735580\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Freeze</a>, <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/b/1/b1349c3d-39ad-40ba-897e-59e5b76de853.jpg?1562201189\" target=\"_blank\">Reprobation</a> etc) Oubliette cannot be removed through Combat, <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/a/0/a03c738c-88d9-4cf6-a650-20ce6e5565bc.jpg?1637630249\" target=\"_blank\">sacrifice</a>, <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/4/9/49ee9af3-d61c-4964-88a6-6e8ad6a6a29a.jpg?1562910438\" target=\"_blank\">bounce</a>, <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/d/4/d45b0ed8-8692-4fa7-b32c-30d29028da3d.jpg?1562939913\" target=\"_blank\">protection</a>, or even a players own kill-spells.</li> <li>It has the power to single-handedly shut down Commander-centric strategies. We believe this is bad for the health and diversity of the format.</li> <li>The last Oracle update (2020) not only changed the way Oubliette interacts with commanders, but it was upshifted to uncommon. The card - as worded now - has never existed at common. *</li> </ol> </div> <h2>What Else Did You Talk About?</h2> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/6/b/6b921a42-8da9-454e-9791-cc3f4da34023.jpg?1632145801\" alt=\"Loyal Apprentice\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>The August Review covered a lot of topics: Partner Commanders, Lieutenants, Monarchy, Initiative, Loyal Apprentice, Baleful Strix, and even sideboards. Without going into it too much, the general stance was that while all of these can be powerful, the data doesn't justify a change at this time.</p> <p>The greatest example of this is Loyal Apprentice, who is seeing a lot of play and boasts a 62% win-rate in recent tournaments. However, this is not the highest! Loyal places 4th when compared to other decks (with 20+ recorded games). The real bogeymen, statistically, are <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/d/e/de0ba512-b6c3-4931-be05-cb6bd03a4b7c.jpg?1644853028\" target=\"_blank\">Keleth</a> or <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/1/7/17416926-168b-49b3-9231-acbb8f8a1d13.jpg?1557577188\" target=\"_blank\">Rakdos</a>!</p> <p>So far we've seen a fantastic amount of deck-diversity in tournaments, and while some decks are performing very well, we don't believe any are dominating (although we continue to watch closely). There were perhaps three areas which came close to a change:</p> <h3>Lotus Petal</h3> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/1/5/153983dd-54dc-420d-9249-665b0d669614.jpg?1573517235\" alt=\"Lotus Petal\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>...and other rituals. In the current meta here at Home Base, aggro and burn decks have been performing extremely well, to the point where we've been considering ways to reign them in (without killing them completely). These are decks like <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/5/c/5cd87cf8-4d5d-4aba-8dfa-800b1fb3799b.jpg?1608910155\" target=\"_blank\">Dargo</a>/<a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/8/6/86958821-76eb-43a5-974b-7c945e826a66.jpg?1611933914\" target=\"_blank\">Esior</a>, <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/a/4/a4fab67f-00c2-4125-9262-d21a29411797.jpg?1644853041\" target=\"_blank\">Rograkh</a>/<a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/d/e/de0ba512-b6c3-4931-be05-cb6bd03a4b7c.jpg?1644853028\" target=\"_blank\">Keleth</a>, and of course Loyal Apprentice.</p> <p>Some of the most unbeatable hands for these decks involve an early Lotus Petal, <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/0/e/0e57335d-4066-4d73-83cd-67a215e01a4e.jpg?1619397622\" target=\"_blank\">Simian Spirit Guide</a> or <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/c/0/c062caf7-f0eb-44db-9f74-e6711a13fada.jpg?1593275318\" target=\"_blank\">Rite of Flame</a>, either because they allow a commander on turn 1, or because they allow a surprise re-cast on turn 3. On the other hand. If drawn late, or while top-decking, a Lotus Petal can be worse than a basic land. So we didn't ban them - it may be that players still need time to adjust to the lower life-totals. Until we have more data, we can only wait and see.</p> <h3>Commons in the Command Zone</h3> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/6/f/6f706ac3-0ad8-44ac-a99e-21c04075951d.jpg?1660723544\" alt=\"Candlekeep Sage\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>A surprisingly contentious subject. Everyone on the RC wants to open up deckbuilding options - but only where safe to do so. We must acknowledge our close-ties with multiplayer PDH. A change to PDC rules here would clash with their decision to not allow common backgrounds. As such there were some concerns this could create a rift, which could hurt the growth of the format. Overall while we believe the risks to the format are minimal, so too are the gains. We will continue to monitor things as they change.</p> <h3>Planeswalker Commanders</h3> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/5/a/5a10b543-d5d4-42a8-9ee8-dada59a2ad7e.jpg?1557577385\" alt=\"Saheeli, Sublime Artificer\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>Similar to the commons debate, planeswalker commanders discussion boiled down to either opening up new and fun deck building options or wanting to stay as close as possible to the PDH ruleset. While more members were in favour of walkers than commons, the subject was raised too late in the review period. So watch closely (we'll review it again early next year!)</p> <p>And that about does it! What do you think? Did we make the right decisions? Did we miss anything? Don't be afraid of upsetting us. Hit us up on Discord. Don't forget to sign up to the next tournament, there's always something going on!</p> <p><strong>* Oubliette Oracle Text changes, in Chronological order:</strong></p> <p>Since its creation the wording on Oubliette has gone through every conceivable iteration! First, it worked like a complicated <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/0/8/0858ab5a-930c-44f0-9621-4dd634cf39c6.jpg?1631233896\" target=\"_blank\">Banishing Light</a>, which tracked auras and counters. Then they tried to simplify it by using phasing, and made it two triggers so it would work like <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/4/6/4686b51c-e02b-48c1-bafe-e8d08a5407b9.jpg?1592712799\" target=\"_blank\">Journey to Nowhere</a>. But then, they removed the phasing (so it ignored equipment - but they kept the two triggers). Finally, they switched it back to phasing, and removed the second triggered ability! See for yourself -</p> <p><a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/3/0/30d1450f-2909-410e-9920-731278fa74de.jpg?1562904037\" target=\"_blank\">1993</a> - Arabian Nights - “Select a creature in play when Oubliette is cast.

    [
      "<p>Welcome to Pauper Duel Commander or PDC! (Also called 1v1 PDH just to keep things confusing) Maybe you are here because you want to join a Discord tournament, or maybe your LGS is hosting a PDC event. This format sounds exciting, but what should you play? And, more importantly, what should you expect to play against?</p> <p>We will keep this brief and to the point. First, we will list the most common archetypes and corresponding commanders and then we will discuss what kind of deck might do well against the top contenders.</p> <p>Before we do that, there are two important things you should know:</p> <p><strong>1.)</strong> This format is young and the metagame is relatively unsolved and unexplored. Brew your own brew! Bring something new! Break the format! PDC is exciting since there is so much room to do your own thing. Don't think that you have to bring the most popular deck to do well…. BUT! You should know what you are up against. Your cool brew will still need to be able to face off against the top decks and win if you want to go anywhere. So, pay attention to what everyone else is playing and show up prepared!</p> <p><strong>2.)</strong> The data that is included in this article is based on two PDC leagues. The first league was held in the spring and summer of 2021 with a relatively small number of players in Italy. This Italian league started off playing with 30 life and 16 commander damage before switching to 25 life and 21 commander damage about half way through the season. So, the results of the Italian league are not exactly representative of the current meta. The second set of data is from a worldwide league held in the summer of 2022. This league had about 18-20 players per week for 10 weeks and it used the standard 25 life and 21 commander damage for the entire time. Even with both of these data sets put together, we still have a very small amount of data available on win percentages and metagame. This data is useful but it is not definitive or exhaustive.</p> <h2>Part 1: The Meta</h2> <h3>Aggressive and Combat Based</h3> <img class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/7/f/7f5e6a5a-18ee-438f-ab16-694e19a2410e.jpg?1562920701\" alt=\"Azra Oddsmaker\"> <p><strong>Example Commanders:</strong> Keleth/Rograkh, Azra Oddsmaker, Fynn the Fangbearer, Reyav Master Smith</p> <p>This archetype is all about putting lots of creatures into play and turning them sideways. There are a few different takes on the strategy, from the enchantment/equipment synergy of Reyav to the infect of Fynn. In 2022, 17% of the decks played were aggressive and combat based and they put up an overall win-rate of 53%.</p> <p>There are several creature-based decks that can be very fast and very consistent. The oldest of these is Azra Oddsmaker. Azra did well in 2021 with an 100% win-rate over just 6 games and put-up strong results again in 2022 with a 58% win-rate over 12 games. Azra combines aggressive creatures with discard synergy to produce card advantage and power on the board.</p> <p>Keleth/Rograkh was played in 13 games in 2021 but finished with a slightly sub-50% score-line. However, this “Red Horse” deck took the number one slot in 2022 with a 63% win-rate over 24 games. This deck boasts aggressive constancy. It can always put its commanders into play turns one and two and it packs the protection to back them up while they grow. It is a scary deck to face any game but it is terrifying when it is 'on the play'.</p> <h3>Burn</h3> <img class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/d/a/dab85ca8-1ce8-43df-a6a1-00fef6b1d1c0.jpg?1631587319\" alt=\"Loyal Apprentice\"> <p><strong>Example Commanders:</strong> Loyal Apprentice</p> <p>There is really only one valid choice for a Red Deck Wins strategy in PDC. Loyal Apprentice. Yes, Loyal counts itself as commander, so you get a Thopter turn two, and every turn after, until Loyal is killed. This ability to pump out evasive creatures, coupled with the huge number of powerful red burn spells printed at common, makes Loyal Apprentice a popular and powerful choice for PDC enthusiasts. Loyal boasted a 71% win-rate in 2021 over 21 games and a 59% win-rate in 2022 over 44 games.</p> <h3>Voltron-ish</h3> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/9/c/9cc51727-e39d-46b5-82cd-0c84c6572155.jpg?1625977527\" alt=\"Crackling Drake\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p><strong>Example Commanders:</strong> Dargo/Esior, Esior/Keleth, Slippery Boggle, Crackling Drake, Sprite Dragon, Dargo/Rograkh</p> <p>The name Voltron typically evokes the idea of a deck that is all-in on one evasive creature that is enchanted and equipped into a huge beater. When we say Voltron-ish we mean that, but we are also counting any deck whose primary game plan is to attack with one big creature, whether or not it is being buffed in the traditional sense. Many single-attacker strategies in PDC don't actually rely on enchantments and equipment to make a creature huge. Some decks, like Dargo, cheat out a large creature early in the game and others, like Sprite Dragon, let a small creature grow through triggered abilities. In 2022, 28% of the decks played were Voltron-ish and they put up an overall win-rate of 49%.</p> <p>Slippery Boggle is a classic PDC commander. But, with the commander damage change, the deck is less of a menace than it used to be. Many savvy pilots turned to other single attacker strategies in 2022, proving the viability of a number of other Voltron commanders.</p> <p>Dargo plus Esior has proven to be a powerful combination. The deck plays a large number of low-cost artifacts and token generators. It uses Dargo's sacrifice ability to play him early under the protection of Esior. This deck was not played at all in 2021, but it burst onto the seen in 2022 with a 65% win-rate over 20 games.</p> <p>The classic Esior and Keleth deck, or Bird-Horse as it is fondly known, is also still a strong option. This deck wants to get both commanders into play early and then protect them with counterspells while they collect counters. Bird-Horse put up a 60% win-rate in 2021 over 10 games and a 65% win-rate in 2022 in 23 games.</p> <p>Sprite Dragon and Crackling Drake can also grow themselves and have the benefit of a stronger color combination than Bird-Horse. But they lack the built-in protection of Esior or Boggle. Crackling Drake was played 29 times in 2021 with an overall win-rate of 59%. Sprite Dragon was played 23 times in 2021 with a 61% win-rate. The commander damage change seems to have had a negative impact on these serpents and in 2022 they were played only 27 times combined with a 37% win-rate together.</p> <h3>Black Based Control</h3> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/b/f/bfb6ba17-6bc0-4626-a604-8b32618a54c5.jpg?1576382150\" alt=\"Knights of the Black Rose\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p><strong>Example Commanders:</strong> Baleful Strix, Knights of the Black Rose, Plaguecrafter, Disciple of Deceit, Sedraxis Specter</p> <p>Control is a viable strategy in PDC, but the jury is still out on which control commander is best. It seems that each control-loving mage has their own pet deck that they insist on running. The common thread through all of the control decks is that they are built around a backbone of black mana. In 2022, 16% of the decks were in the Black Based Control architype. And their overall win-rate was a healthy 58%.</p> <p>Baleful Strix is an old PDC deck that saw less play in 2022 than in previous years. This deck is a traditional permission deck that uses the annoying bird to slow down opponents while gaining card advantage. Sometimes, the deck includes a combo finish. In 2021, Strix was present for a whopping 56 games with an impressive 73% win-rate. In 2022, the deck was only tried for 16 games and its win-rate dropped to 50%.</p> <p>Knights of the Black Rose was played by one dedicated pilot in both 2021 and 2022. The deck eschews counterspells and leans into quality black removal and card advantage from the command zone. The cheeky inclusion of the Rune of Protection cycle also continues to perform frustratingly well. The deck was played 10 times in 2021 with a 60% win-rate and 17 times in 2022 with a 65% win-rate. It finished in second place.</p> <p>The most common mono-black choice for the format seems to be Plaguecrafter. This control deck respects Voltron so much that is includes an edict in the command zone! It is packed full of removal along with some creatures to sacrifice, and includes all of the best black 60-card pauper staples. Plaguecrafter was played 6 times in 2021 with a 67% win-rate and 11 times in 2022 with a 73% win-rate.</p> <h3>Midrange?</h3> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/d/5/d5f69e24-6b5c-4a9a-af5b-1ce88efdc0aa.jpg?1608909570\" alt=\"Armix, Filigree Thrasher\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p><strong>Example Commanders:</strong> Armix/Toggo, Mayhem Devil</p> <p>It seems that a lot of homebrews fell into the Midrange category but haven't particularly performed well. Midrange decks (and some other decks that have no home; like combo) played in 25% of games in 2022 with a disappointing overall win-rate of 44%.</p> <p>Mayhem Devil is a standout in this category. This Black-Red deck plays all of the good blood and treasure generating cards and sacrifices them while the commander is on the board to ping all of their opponent's creatures to death or to just put damage straight to face. This deck was not tried in 2021 but finished well in 2022 with a 65% win-rate over 22 games.</p> <p>Armix and Toggo is another popular Black-Red deck of the PDC format. This partner deck loosely relies on artifact and discard synergy alongside the removal provided by both commanders, to grind out a win. It was a popular choice in 2021, being played in 37 games with a 73% win-rate. In 2022 it was only played in 9 games with a disappointing 44% finish.</p> <h2>Part 2: What To Play?</h2> <h3>Play Early Removal</h3> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/a/e/ae5f9fb1-5a55-4db3-98a1-2628e3598c18.jpg?1648155765\" alt=\"Lightning Bolt\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>After two years of PDC leagues, and over 600 games, we have hopefully learned a few things about what is important in a PDC deck. The first lesson is that early removal is critical. Most decks play two mana removal, but it is also important to include disruption that can be cast on turn one. Some of the faster decks of the format will be established on the board with shields up by their turn two or three. If you cannot deal with them before then, you will have a harder time as the game progresses. That is why it is important to run a decent amount of removal in general, but also to specifically include a suite of one-mana removal spells. In red and black decks this is not that difficult, but the options are fairly limited in some of the other colors. Consider including cards like Sun Lance and Force Spike, or enchantments like Kirtar's Desire and Witness Protection if you don't have access to black or red.</p> <h3>Edicts Are Important</h3> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/9/6/9659cf39-5ca8-4c56-9f15-2a7201cf32f1.jpg?1562925286\" alt=\"Chainer's Edict\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>Voltron-ish decks account for 28% of the meta, and they are putting up respectable results. A deck that does not have a plan to beat a single large beater is going to have a hard time. Most of these Voltron decks use some sort of protection to keep their guy on the board, so traditional removal cannot always be relied on. This is why edicts are so important in this format. An edict is a card that forces the opponent to sacrifice a creature. Diabolic Edict and Chainer's Edict are examples. Black has the most options, and if you are a black deck, you should consider running a good number of them. White has Celestial Flare and blue has Curfew. I would recommend running both of these cards in most white or blue builds. Red can use cards like End the Festivities or Fiery Cannonade against a Voltron deck that starts small, like Slippery Boggle or Sprite Dragon, but those cards don't work well against something like Crackling Drake. Regardless of your color combination, you should have a plan to beat a Voltron deck.</p> <h3>Just Be Faster</h3> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/a/4/a4fab67f-00c2-4125-9262-d21a29411797.jpg?1644853041\" alt=\"Rograkh, Son of Rohgahh\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>If your deck doesn't have an answer to a Voltron threat or it doesn't want to be spending cards on removal, there is another path. You can just race the opponent. Playing the beatdown deck is a perfectly valid option. There are few options for board wipes in the format, so brew up a go wide strategy or maybe Gruul aggro. (Someone needs to come up with a good Bloodbraid Elf deck!). If you don't want to come up with something of your own, you could always pick up a tried-and-true deck like Loyal Apprentice or Keleth and Rograkh. Not everyone wants to play a deck that tries to counter every move the other player makes, and that's ok. Just race them instead. In is format, that is a perfectly valid option.</p> <h3>Don't Forget the Late-Game</h3> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/0/6/06254b6c-eb22-4ec9-9420-74e9ee15e072.jpg?1562052328\" alt=\"Disturbed Burial\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>Consider this a warning. PDC is not like 60-card magic. You will never, truly, run your opponent out of resources. (ok, ok, except for Oubliette) They will always have their commander to recast, again and again. Every time you have to spend another card killing a commander, you go down in resources in exchange for their loss of tempo. Against a partner deck this is especially true. At the start of the game, it is ok to trade a removal spell for a commander, but as the game goes on it becomes more and more taxing. Therefore, it is critical that slower decks include card advantage engines that will sustain them through the late game. This could be things with buyback like Disturbed Burial or Evincar's Justice or cards that draw cards, like Destructive Digger, Dark-Dweller Oracle or Ninja of the Deep Hours. Monarch and Initiative cards also fill this role as long as you can keep control of the board. A slow deck is going to want multiple ways to stay in a long game without running out of things to do.</p> <p>With that, go and break the format! PDC is too young and too infrequently played to have been solved yet! You could be the one to blow it wide open.</p> <p>Thank you for reading!</p>"

      "<p>This short article is a follow-up to the <a href=\"article108.html\">Backgrounds Ruling & Reasoning</a> article from the end of last month. We knew Wizards would have to update the comprehensive rules to make backgrounds work in the command zone, so we were waiting to update our own rules so that we could match their wording. Wizards did that update a few days ago (see the 702.124H entry in <a href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/comprehensive-rules-changes-2022-06-01\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a> for details), so here's the Pauper EDH rules update.</p> <p>Just like “Partner With” and “Friends Forever,” choosing a background is categorized as a variant of the Partner mechanic and gets its own separate rules entry. The Pauper EDH rules text for this new ability is below. Differences from the regular Commander rules are bolded.</p> <p class=\"indent\"><strong>907.7.</strong> “Choose a Background” is a variant of the partner ability that represents a static ability. “Choose a Background” means “You may designate two cards as your commander as long as one of them is this card and the other is a legendary Background enchantment.” You can't designate two cards as your commander if one has a “choose a Background” ability and the other is not a Background enchantment, and legendary Background enchantments cannot be your commander unless you have also designated a commander with “choose a Background.” <strong>In Pauper EDH, both the card with “Choose a Background” and the Background enchantment must be of uncommon rarity to be legal commanders.</strong></p> <p>We're also making one other change. Our old rule 906.3a specified that any planeswalker with the “can be your commander” ability still had to be an uncommon in order to be a legal Pauper EDH commander (even though no uncommon planeswalkers had yet been printed with that ability). This matched the Commander rule at the time, but that Commander rule was changed recently to accommodate <a href=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/9/6/969ac7dd-f3aa-4888-9ff0-d16a31b5e7a9.jpg?1653966849\" target=\"_blank\">Shorikai, Genesis Engine</a>. So we're updating the Pauper EDH rule to match the new wording of the Commander rule, which no longer specifies planeswalkers (implying that other noncreature cards can be your commander as long as they have the “can be your commander” ability). Our new rule text is listed below, with differences between the Pauper EDH and Commander rules bolded.</p> <p class=\"indent\"><strong>906.3a.</strong> Some cards have an ability that states the card can be your commander. This ability modifies the rules for deck construction, and it functions before the game begins. <strong>These cards must be of uncommon rarity to be legal commanders in Pauper EDH.</strong> See also rule 113.6n.</p> <p>As always, thank you for your patience as we work through the details of updating our rules. We hope you're enjoying brewing with Backgrounds as much as we are!</p>"

    [
      "<p><strong>A Celebration, Damnation, History and Primer</strong></p> <p>On this day ten years ago, Wizards released a janky little pre-con all about sneaking through attackers, and making value out of bouncing and re-casting your own creatures. It was a Ninjas deck, but with it they created an unassuming little bird of ill-omen, Baleful Strix. Well, players quickly found a better use for it, and Strix made its mark on many formats, none more so than our own Pauper Duel Commander! For many of us, it's been the poster child of the format, and a force to be reckoned with ever since.</p> <p><strong>Four Years Ago</strong></p> <p>Strix is omnipresent, everyone in Duel either plays it or fears it, and it's even made a few waves in multiplayer. But 2018 was a big year, massive, in it we gained: Satyr Enchanter, Crackling Drake, Azra Oddsmaker, Plaguecrafter, Tatyova, Benthic Druid, Loyal Apprentice, and a Slippery Bogle upshift (for those of us who weren't using commons). Two years later we got the uncommon Partners, and the hits keep on coming. All this to say, every single archetype has had an upgrade, and for the first time in PDC history, Strix players had some serious competition from every angle.Some could argue then, Strix isn't king of the hill anymore. But I don't think that's a bad thing...</p> <p><strong>Let's Be Honest, Wizards Made a Mistake!</strong></p> <p>I love Strix, but some have argued it should have never been an uncommon. It was a pre-con exclusive, where rarity was based purely on the number of them printed in the deck, not the power of the card! Wizards “corrected” this in Eternal Masters, but have gone back and forth ever since. Personally, I think it was simply ahead of its time. Before 2018 it was unchallenged, too powerful, too easy to build, and off-putting to newer players. But by today's meta, Strix has some serious competition!</p> <p><strong>So What Does The Future Look Like?</strong></p> <p>Let's be clear, Strix isn't going anywhere. It still offers more card advantage, more immediately and for less mana than any other commander. It's in great colours, and synergises with tonnes of effects like bounce, flicker, Monarchy (Initiative), and “creatures with flying” cards.</p> <p>But the March 2022 announcement on life totals made a dent, and the meta is now evolving. Voltron is down but not out, burn decks are rampant, and players are more aware of Strix than ever. Perhaps it's time for Strix to evolve as well. Happy Birthday Baleful Strix!</p> <p>What do you think? Hit us up with those comments or take it over to the Discord :) Wait, You Wanted A Primer? Okay fine, here is <a href=\"https://www.moxfield.com/decks/0PzEv3jW80mZ3U_tYepeKw\" target=\"_blank\">my Baleful Strix list</a>. Take a good look, it's a little different to the usual net-decks.</p> <p><strong>What does the deck do?</strong></p> <p>(Experienced players, feel free to scroll past this bit.) This is a “hard-control” deck. Your aim is to destroy, counter, or otherwise prevent everything your opponent is trying to do. You should be trying to draw more cards than them, while collecting information about their hand and strategy. Once they've run out of ammo, play one of your wincons and put them out of their misery. I won't teach you how to play control here, but my best advice: pick your battles. You don't actually need to kill and counter everything, just identify the things that can really hurt you, or make value for your opponent. A good understanding of their strategy will help you, so familiarise yourself with the meta (Check out this <a href=\"https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/pauper-duel-commander-tier-list-pdc-duel-pdh/\" target=\"_blank\">Tier List</a> for a rough idea).</p> <p><strong>Who will like this deck?</strong></p> <p>Anyone who enjoys a long game with lots of interaction, someone who wants to play the player, as well as just the cards. Probably not suited for someone who gets salty easily, it can be disheartening to play a 50-minute game only to die to a top-deck lightning bolt. If this is you play something else, perhaps Yu-Gi-Oh! :'D</p> <p><strong>Gameplay and Tough Matchups</strong></p> <p>To tap out is to show weakness! Your opponent will expect you to kill or counter everything they do, so let them believe it (even when you can't). You can expect them to try and play around your answers; don't be baited into removing something you don't need to, they are hoping to clear the way for something scarier.</p> <p>VS. Burn (not necessarily the same as aggro) - Mulligan aggressively to some low-cost interaction, then you should be able to quash their early offensive. You can easily get on top in terms of card advantage. But don't get too comfortable, they have more burn than you have counterspells; if you take too long they will top-deck enough to finish you. (Think about this when you cast Ponder, or cycle a Striped Riverwinder!). If your meta is heavy on burn decks, try some of the killspells that gain life. Crypt Incursion can be massive (but terrible in a Mirror Match).</p> <p>VS. Control (Mirror Match) - Information is power, but don't get trigger happy. A turn one Gitaxian Probe is great, but you can fully expect the game to go long, so think about holding it until you're ready to attempt something scary. Your early game should be focused on trying to attain card advantage over your opponent (Look for the Monarchy or ways to bounce Strix for a re-cast). Your win-cons will evade most removal, but beware of counterspells and edicts. Strix and the other utility creatures are great fodder for the latter, and will make the opponent use their removal for little value.</p> <p><strong>Why are(n't) you playing this card?</strong></p> <p>There are a few cards that people question from time to time: the big creature wincons, Flicker Combo, Viridian Longbow, and the powerful (but painful) killspells like Snuff Out, vendetta, and Ashes to Ashes. I won't go into each one of them, but if you're interested in my reasonings drop a comment below. I'm happy to break it down, so you can decide whether it's worth the include or not.</p> <p>And that's it. So if you're still reading then my job as the control player is done! I hope you enjoyed the journey, thanks for reading, good luck and have fun!</p>"

    [
      "<p>So you've <span style=\"color: red;\">playtested your PDH deck</span>, and you've even <span style=\"color: red;\">put it together in paper</span>, but have you considered how it'll play against EDH decks?</p> <p>First, you need to consider your commander. If your commander is a legendary uncommon creature, you will not need to ask permission to play your deck in EDH. If your commander is not a legendary uncommon creature, you will need to ask your opponents' permission to play it in EDH. Regardless, everyone should discuss their decks before playing. PDH, also known as Pauper EDH, is at a natural disadvantage, and discussion could lead to a better play experience.</p> <p>Most of the disadvantages Pauper EDH decks face are because of the format's rarity restrictions. Uncommon commanders are often not as powerful as higher rarity commanders, and a deck of commons cannot be as powerful as a deck of cards at any rarity. To demonstrate these facts, let's examine some cards.</p> <p>The Beamtown Bullies and Mr. Orfeo, the Boulder are two recent commanders that share the same mana cost, but are very different in terms of power.</p> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/f/0/f0455a79-15f4-4ea6-87ae-263ce943cfac.jpg?1650420213\" alt=\"The Beamtown Bullies\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>Soon after being cast, The Beamtown Bullies can eliminate an opponent, and it only takes one card to set it up. For example, Entomb puts Leveler in the graveyard, and The Beamtown Bullies give it to an opponent so they lose on their next draw. Being able to eliminate an opponent soon after you cast them, and needing only one other card to set it up makes The Beamtown Bullies powerful!</p> <p>To eliminate an opponent, Mr. Orfeo, the Boulder needs a creature to attack. Because he doesn't have haste and has a low base power, he relies on multiple cards to be effective.</p> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/9/7/97caaa92-2a7d-4f79-8d42-86733c902072.jpg?1649880285\" alt=\"Mr. Orfeo, the Boulder\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>For example, doubling the power of an attacking Kiln Fiend with Tainted Strike cast on it. If an opponent can't block, they'll get 10 poison counters and lose. If all of your opponents can block, cards like Fling can help finish one off. Needing to attack, and relying on multiple cards makes Mr. Orfeo, the Boulder less powerful than the Beamtown Bullies.</p> <p>Beyond uncommon commanders often being less powerful, the biggest disadvantage of Pauper EDH decks comes from all the other cards being commons. Higher rarity cards are inherently more powerful. It usually takes much more mana, or multiple commons to match the effects of a higher rarity card. That is, if they can match them at all!</p> <p>Sol Ring is the most played card in EDH. It generates more mana than it costs, and it can use that mana right away to cast other spells. The speed of Sol Ring and other fast rocks accelerate EDH decks far beyond anything Pauper EDH ones can match.</p> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/1/9/199cde21-5bc3-49cd-acd4-bae3af6e5881.jpg?1654118835\" alt=\"Sol Ring\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>You can get the same effect at common, but you have to pay three more mana for it. That is a huge difference in speed! With such a high mana value, Sisay's Ring is too slow for most decks.</p> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/2/0/20c0e608-0208-408a-b473-1e54caa96cea.jpg?1608911699\" alt=\"Sisay's Ring\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>Big spells are what define EDH, and Craterhoof Behemoth is one of the most infamous ones. It can eliminate an opponent with only a few creatures on board, and the bigger the board, the more opponents it can beat.In Pauper EDH, there are creatures that give evasion when they enter, creatures that give pluses when they enter, and creatures with large bodies, but there are no creatures that combine all three. It will take multiple commons to create a similar effect, but they likely will not match the efficacy.</p> <p>Cyclonic Rift is the most obnoxious board wipe in EDH! Returning only opponents' nonland permanents to their hands is an amazing effect, and doing it whenever you want is super powerful! Cyclonic Rift is more of a win condition than a board wipe though.There aren't many board wipes at common, but most of them are damage based and hit all creatures. Since there is a lack of board wipes in Pauper EDH, it's hard to stop opponents from developing a big board. There aren't any commons that can match the effects of Cyclonic Rift at all.</p> <p>The majority of uncommon creatures, and commons are designed for draft, but most cards designed for EDH are rares. So, trying to match the power of EDH is something Pauper EDH decks will always struggle with.If a Pauper EDH deck had to play against an EDH deck 1 v 1, the EDH deck would probably win every game. Fortunately, EDH is not a 1 v 1 format, and the self-balancing nature of its games open up opportunities for disadvantaged decks to win. The most threatening decks tend to get eliminated first, and because Pauper EDH decks are usually less threatening, they tend to survive late into the game. After all, it just doesn't make sense to take out the weakest deck first!</p> <p>However, being the weakest doesn't mean that Pauper EDH decks get to win for free. A lot of them need their commander to win, so needing to resolve and keep their commander out is an exploitable weakness.</p> <p>Creatures like Drannith Magistrate, and commanders like Kelsien, the Plague are a huge hurdle! Not being able to cast, or keep your commander out locks a lot of Pauper EDH decks out of the game. So, having enough removal for these is a necessity!</p> <p>Speaking of removal, cards like Rule of Law also need to be removed for Pauper EDH decks to play effectively! Being able to cast only one spell per turn really slows down a lot of decks, and it shuts down most Pauper EDH combo decks.</p> <p>Combo is one of the strongest deck archetypes in EDH. Because combo decks can win without warning, they tend to get taken out first. Even if they're Pauper EDH decks! In spite of that, combo decks are still the most likely to win an average game of EDH. Especially if it has a combo with your commander!Well supported draft archetypes are a decent alternative to combo. For example, Elf tribal, and sacrifice. They usually have enough cards at common for their decks to make an impact even without the commander. Since these archetypes tend to be less commander reliant, they are less likely to get locked out of the game. If your deck isn't running a strategy like these, you will want to consider incorporating one that synergizes with it.</p> <p>So in review, you'll want everyone to discuss their decks before playing PDH Vs EDH. You'll have to accept the fact that you're at a disadvantage, and you'll need a lot of removal to avoid getting locked out of the game. Finally, you'll want to focus your deck towards a well supported strategy, so you can make an impact even without your commander.</p> <p>Best of luck, and may Richard Garfield have mercy on you for your lack of rares.</p>"

      "<h2>Indulge me in a hypothetical.</h2> <p>Imagine, if you will, that you have a friend who's been blind since birth. One day, she undergoes a revolutionary new surgery, and for the first time in her entire life, she's wandering around with you and seeing things. She turns to you and asks: “What is Red?”</p> <p>Red is … difficult to define? It's not something you've consciously thought about for years. Distilling the essence of a lifetime of red-colored experiences into words is not an easy task, and yet here it sits before you. One option available to you is to precisely define red. So you turn to your friend and confidently say “Red is visible light with a wavelength between 610 and 660 nanometers.”</p> <p>Nailed it.</p> <p>But… your friend looks disappointed. How is it possible that this precise scientific definition of the color, so clear about what does and does not count as red, has fallen flat? You try something else: instead of defining red, you describe it. Red is the color of stop signs, of firetrucks, of these roses and those tulips, of that woman's lipstick or that man's shirt or that other person's fingernails. It's a color for fire and passion and warnings and love and spiciness.</p> <p>This works! Now she's getting into the red-ness of things, excitedly pointing them out on her own (except for when she gets overzealous and you have to say “no, that's orange”).</p> <h2>“Cool story Dave, but it seems pointless? What does it have to do with PDH?”</h2> <p>This is the story I use to explain the utility of definitions vs descriptions. Definitions are precise tools of experts, used to create a very clear boundary between what is and what is not. Descriptions are vague and nebulous example-laden introductions for beginners, and they allow folks to build up their basic experiences of what is and is not.</p> <p>This is all relevant because Wizards has just dropped Backgrounds on us, and we are all novice beginners when it comes to Backgrounds.</p> <h2>What is a background?</h2> <p>“Background” is a new mechanic in Magic's new Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate set, and this set's version of the Partner mechanic. Commander Legends is meant to be drafted, which naturally conflicts with Commander's rigid color-identity rules. Partner provides players with an easy way to pivot from one color pair to another: instead of having to find a new legendary creature with the right colors, they can just swap out one of their two commanders for one that matches the new plan. The problem with Partner is that, the more partners get printed, the more out-of-control the mechanic gets. So finding new alternatives is important for Wizards.</p> <p>Enter Backgrounds: this is a new way to partner up two cards so that they can both be your commander, but in a way that doesn't compound the power-scaling problems of “Partner.”</p> <p>Every mono-color legendary creature in Battle for Baldur's Gate has the text “Choose a background.” If you choose one of these creatures to be your commander, you can also choose an enchantment with the subtype “background” to be your second commander - they partner up so that you have two commanders (and hopefully two colors worth of color identity with which to build your deck).</p> <h2>“You still haven't explained what this has to do with PDH”</h2> <p>I'm getting there! OK, so lots of these mono-color legendary creatures in Baldur's Gate are uncommon, so they can be your PDH commander. Which is awesome for us! And they let you choose a background, which is also awesome. So now we, the Rules Committee, are faced with an unprecedented decision to make:</p> <h2>Which backgrounds are legal to use as commanders in PDH?</h2> <p>This is a more difficult decision than it looks like.</p> <p>Lots of folks saw the text “Choose a background” on creatures and felt that made the enchantment sort of subordinate to the creature, so they assumed we'd only be allowing common backgrounds. There's nothing about backgrounds that naturally puts them into the command zone, only the ability “Choose a background” on a creature does that.</p> <p>Lots of other folks saw the text “Can be your second commander” and felt that, since the things that historically go into the command zone in PDH are uncommons, that we'd only be allowing uncommon backgrounds.</p> <p>Lots of other other folks saw the cool new mechanic and wanted to leave all options open to brewers, so they wanted to make all common and uncommon backgrounds legal PDH commanders.</p> <p>We (the Rules Committee) talked about this for weeks, and the purpose of this article is to share with you some of the points we brought up on both sides, and the decision we ultimately made.</p> <h2>SPOILERS: Everyone is on board with uncommon backgrounds being legal commanders.</h2> <p>Literally no one is against that. If you're reading and worried about whether or not you can use Criminal Past: you can, bless your wayward criminal heart. This article is pretty much entirely about whether or not we should also allow common backgrounds into the command zone.</p> <h2>“PDH has always been about putting an uncommon in the command zone”</h2> <p>There are a lot of assumptions wrapped up in this sentence, so let's unpack that. “Always” is an appeal to tradition, “has been about” is an appeal to the format's philosophy (which, at the moment, no one has written down or agrees on), and “an uncommon” conveniently leaves off the other commander requirements: that the commander is a creature, is not a land, and that other rules apply if it has something like “Partner,” “Partner with,” or “Choose a background.”</p> <p>Still: this is a very compelling point. Historically, as long as there have been official rules, we have only allowed creatures with an uncommon printing as legal commanders. The introduction of backgrounds feels like a weird reason to disrupt nearly a decade of format-defining precedent. And it really is format-defining: the entirety of our format's existence is based on rarity-based deck-building restrictions. Allowing common commanders in general would be a drastic shift in what is and isn't allowed, and allowing common backgrounds feels like a weird exception to make.</p> <h2>It really would be weird to create an exception just for this. I mean, there are only 5 common backgrounds.</h2> <p>In addition to being a weird exception to make, it's a weird exception to write about, since it applies equally to both sides of this argument. Proponents of common backgrounds are saying “There are only five, what's the harm in allowing 5 extra cards as potential commanders?” and opponents are saying “you're only losing access to 5 cards, you can get over it.”</p> <p>The real argument being had here, though, is about the cleanliness of the rules. We want our rules to be clean and streamlined and easy to understand at a glance, which is why we say “your commander can be any uncommon creature” when we introduce the format to our friends. There are, of course, extra bits: “Or two uncommon creatures if they have the “partner” ability or the “partner with [each other's name]” ability, or one uncommon creature with “choose a background” and an enchantment with the background subtype, but not Dryad Arbor 'cause it's a land, but Tangled Florahedron is fine because the land is the back face but you can't play the land face from the command zone, and if your uncommon creature has adventure here's how that works…” These extra details get left off because they're part of the definition--they create very specific boundaries and help people at those boundaries navigate their weird edge-cases. What we're trying to do is provide a description to serve as an introduction for our novice friends.</p> <p>What this boils down to is an issue of where we draw the line on our descriptions vs. our definitions. Opponents of allowing common backgrounds don't want to have to build the “common or uncommon background” clause into their casual descriptions of what a legal commander is; they feel it's a weird exception to have to make for only 5 cards. Proponents feel like putting backgrounds into these descriptions at all is a weird departure from the norm, and that the formal definition is already changing to allow backgrounds, so this would be a very small edit to an already big change.</p> <h2>This formal definition thing is already complex enough with partners and backgrounds and all the other shenanigans that EDH players don't have to deal with. Allowing a very specific subset of commons will just confuse the players.</h2> <p>We definitely do not want to confuse players! We're trying to streamline this to be as intuitive as possible. The problem lies in what different folks think of as intuitive. As I already mentioned, people had many different initial interpretations of this, in terms of what backgrounds they felt should or shouldn't be legal commanders. We have to keep in mind, as we discuss this, that what's intuitive for one person might not be intuitive for another.</p> <p>The bigger issue to consider for keeping things simple, streamlined, and intuitive, is: we don't want to make a ruling here that'll undermine our other rules. Officially, you can't use a common creature as your PDH commander (even if that commander is pretty interesting). Allowing common backgrounds into the command zone might not confuse players in terms of backgrounds, but it absolutely sends a mixed message about putting other commons into the command zone, like Ponyback Brigade or Naya Hushblade. The rules committee, for all our disagreements, are extremely united in the importance of not sending mixed messages about our core rules.</p> <h2>“Damn, Ponyback Brigade looks sweet. What if I want that AND common backgrounds to be legal?”</h2> <p>Allowing all common creatures into the Command Zone is something we talked about over the last few weeks. It would definitively solve the question of common backgrounds! But would it damage the health and diversity of the format? Would it change the competitive scene? What's really at risk here by opening up the floodgates to a few thousand extra commander options?</p> <p>It was difficult to articulate our feelings about this option. The honest answer to these questions is that opening up the command zone to any common creature would have an incredibly minor impact on the format's metagame. So many of the common creatures just… don't do anything interesting, and the interesting options almost always have more interesting and more powerful uncommon analogues. Allowing common creatures to be commanders would honestly change very little. So what's the harm in pulling that trigger to see what happens?</p> <p>First of all, that's not a trigger we can un-pull, so it's something we need to be absolutely sure we want to happen before we take that plunge. And we're not absolutely sure. There's a uniqueness about a single uncommon among a pile of commons. A special-ness to that card that sets it apart from the rest of the deck. EDH has its legendaries; PDH has its uncommons. We want to preserve that special-ness.</p> <h2>“What? 'Special-ness'? That's stupid. Why are you preventing me from building a Ponyback deck?”</h2> <p>We are, as always, fully supportive of your experimentation and exploration. Rule zero is here for you! Build the Ponyback deck and then play it. Play it against me personally, I badly want to see it in action. But recognize, as you build it, that it's technically not a legal commander, and you should ask your playgroup if they're OK with it before you start a game. (For the record: I, Alkadron, am always OK with it.)</p> <p>This is what Rule Zero is all about: some people want to build the most powerful deck they can under a rigid set of constraints, and other people want to bend the rules a bit to explore something fun or to express themselves. PDH has room for both kinds of players (and everyone in between) because of Rule Zero.</p> <h2>“Uh oh. You're talking about Rule Zero in the context of things I'm not technically allowed to do. I know what this means for common backgrounds.”</h2> <p>You know exactly what this means for common backgrounds, especially if you read <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/PauperEDH/comments/uvpn8r/background_legality_ruling/\" target=\"_blank\">Scarecrow's announcement</a> from the 23rd. After weeks of discussion, we put the matter to a vote, and the results of that vote were:</p> <div class=\"indent\"> <p>Six RC members voting against allowing common backgrounds in the command zone</p> <p>Four RC members voting for allowing common backgrounds in the command zone</p> <p>Zero RC members abstaining.</p> </div> <p>We decided ahead of time that this would be a simple majority-rules vote, and so for now, we have officially made the ruling that common backgrounds are not allowed in the command zone. Which brings us right back to Rule Zero: if you're upset about this decision and curious to see how one plays, build the deck, get permission from your playgroup to play it, and let us know how it goes!</p> <h2>“This has been an enormous amount of text for what feels like a really simple decision.”</h2> <p>This decision was anything but simple - there's an enormous amount of nuance and implication and format philosophy and intuitive-ness underlying every aspect of this decision, and we all felt differently about different aspects of it, and it all came up in our discussions. I wrote this massive wall of text so that no one would think we took this lightly, because we didn't.</p> <p>Anyways, thanks for coming on this journey with me, friend! I hope you depart this article with a more nuanced understanding of our decision than you entered with, whether or not you agree with it. Either way, let us know what you think by hopping into the PDH Home Base Discord Server or our Facebook page or our subreddit.</p>"

      "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p><strong>“Infinite ideas flow through the Multiverse, waiting for an open mind” - The Biblioplex: An Introduction</strong></p> <p>Your opponents in Magic, and in Duel PDH, try to present you with an unsolvable board state. But what if you always had the answer? This commander does.</p> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/f/b/fbfe88fd-9bb9-42af-8134-96fd264b8405.jpg?1593096393\" alt=\"Disciple of Deceit\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>Today we will go over how I built my first, and favorite, Duel PDH deck. Disciple of Deceit is a blue-black control deck, but it isn't just a run-of-the-mill draw-go deck. It is built like a toolbox. This is because the commander has a special Inspired ability, more specifically, whenever he becomes untapped you may discard a nonland card to search your library for a card of the same converted mana cost. So, this means that, if we build our deck right, we should be able to go grab whatever the situation calls for during our upkeep…. that is, if we can get Disciple tapped.</p> <h2>Tapping and Tutoring</h2> <p><strong>“When defeat is near and guidance is scarce, all eyes look in one direction” - Source unknown</strong></p> <p>You could, of course, attack with the commander to get her tapped. And, often times you can if you keep the path clear with removal spells. But sometimes attacking would be a bad proposition, so what is the backup plan?</p> <p>First off, there are two lands that can tap the commander for colored mana, Survivors' Encampment and Holdout Settlement. These lands are great since they come into play untapped and can often make colored mana and they help out with our tapping issue.</p> <p>Secondly, there is Springleaf Drum. This one mana artifact taps a creature to generate a colored mana. And, it can be tutored for by Trinket Mage…. but we are getting ahead of ourselves. Sometimes, if you don't think you are going to have another good attack with Disciple of Deceit, you may actually want to use your first tutor to go get Springleaf Drum so that you can continue tutoring on later turns.</p> <p>Finally, if you are in a pinch, you can use Viridian Longbow to tap the commander. This is not the only reason the equipment is in the deck (more on that later) but it can work if you really need it to.</p> <p>When the commander untaps she discards a card. This can allow us to play synergistic cards which might benefit from this such as Madness cards and others. In the end, I have cut every Madness card that was in the deck. The test I used to determine if a Madness card was worth including was whether I would be ok playing it for its full cost. There is no guarantee that the commander will be on the board and those Madness cards might just be dead draws when you are already in a tight spot.</p> <p>But other cards synergize with the commander as well. These include; things with Flashback or Jumpstart like Mystical Teachings, Chainer's Edict, Dihada's Ploy and Forbidden Alchemy, as well as cards with Delve like Logic Knot. Another card that works well with the commander is Brainstorm. Brainstorm is often a trap in most decks since there are not that many shuffle effects in PDH to get rid of the chaff that you put back on top, but with the commander's tutor ability, a well-timed Brainstorm will let you see three more cards before you discard as well as put two unwanted cards back into your library (and not on top because of the shuffle from the tutoring).</p> <p>Besides the commander, there are several other tutors in the deck. We have already discussed Mystical Teachings and Trinket Mage, and the deck also includes Muddle the Mixture and Shred Memory which can get a 2-drop for the cost of three mana and Merchant Scroll which can search for a blue instant card. Remember the Merchant Scroll and Mystical Teachings can both get Gush, this will be important later.</p> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/9/a/9a7800f7-95cd-4f5c-b054-4afad8924367.jpg?1658650117\" alt=\"Trinket Mage\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>Whenever Trinket Mage is included in a deck, there needs to be an accompanying Trinket Mage Package. These are the 0-1 cost artifacts that the Wizard can search for. Ideally these cards cover a variety of scenarios. The cards that I have chosen are the following:</p> <div class=\"indent\"> <ul> <li>Executioner's Capsule - Kill a non-black creature</li> <li>Springleaf Drum - Tap the commander</li> <li>Viridian Longbow - Synergize with deathtouch creatures or tap the commander</li> <li>Seat of the Synod - Blue mana</li> <li>Vault of Whispers - Black mana</li> <li>Mistvault Bridge - Blue of black mana but tapped</li> </ul> </div> <h2>The Plan</h2> <p><strong>“Always give your foes a choice when they have none.” - Ob Nixilis</strong></p> <p>So, we have figured out how to tap our commander. Now what? What is this deck supposed to be doing? I have built the list to be a creature-based-ETB-combo-control-toolbox deck. So, in simple terms, this means that we are a control deck that plays a lot of creatures and wins with a combo eventually. Since our combo is an ETB based combo (see below for details) we are going to play primarily ETB creatures to maximize on the usefulness of the combo pieces. ETB creatures are those that do something when they Enter the Battlefield. Things like Chittering Rats and Fleshbag Marauder are ETB creatures.</p> <p>I chose to be a creature-based control deck since the format is so creature heavy. Almost every deck wants to win by attacking with creatures. Since the format has so few sweepers, save for things like Pestilence and Crypt Rats , blockers can be important. (note that there area a few other wraths in black that deal one or two to everything that we don't play as well as a few in red that deal 2 or 5 to everything)</p> <p>In an ideal game, the first few turns are spent killing their first creatures and playing our commander. Cards like Fungal Infection and Disfigure are great at this. Then a few useful creatures hit the board as we hold up counter magic like Deprive and Mana Leak. Perhaps we clear the board with a Pestilence or Crypt Rats. Later in the game, once the opponent has been run out of resources, we start tutoring for combo pieces to finish them off. The combo will be covered in a section below. Besides the combo, the deck can win by just attacking with random 2/2's or by abusing a non-infinite flicker such as Ghostly Flicker with Gray Merchant of Asphodel + Mnemonic Wall or Chittering Rats + Salvager of Secrets as targets.</p> <h2>The Control Shell</h2> <p><strong>“The fatal flaw in every plan is the assumption that you know more than your enemy” - Source Unknown</strong></p> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/8/c/8c052464-0e9c-4ac6-af50-ef81711972c8.jpg?1604195253\" alt=\"Soul Manipulation\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>As a control deck, we must play a decent number of counter spells and removal. Blue + Black is the best color combination for this, especially in Duel PDH. This is where we get into the meat of the deck list. For counter spells, generic two-cost counters were prioritized. By generic I mean that the counter will catch most spells. I avoided things that only countered instants or only countered spells that targeted a creature where possible. These are the spells that were chosen:</p> <div class=\"indent\"> <ul> <li>Counterspell</li> <li>Deprive - Don't forget about bouncing Mystic Sanctuary and Bojuka Bog!</li> <li>Logic Knot</li> <li>Mana Leak</li> <li>Muddle the Mixture - Doubles as a tutor or counter</li> <li>Negate</li> <li>Essence Scatter</li> <li>Soul Manipulation - Doubles as a counter AND a recursion spell</li> </ul> </div> <p>For non-creature-based removal spells, the deck prioritizes low-cost, instant-speed options that did not have restrictive conditions attached. (This is why it does not include Doom Blade or Murder) These are the spells that were chosen:</p> <div class=\"indent\"> <ul> <li>Chainer's Edict</li> <li>Curfew - A one-cost option to deal with Voltron that also gives you value</li> <li>Disfigure</li> <li>Fungal Infection -The token often matters</li> <li>Lash of Malice - Don't forget that this can be used to give one of your creatures +2 Attack</li> <li>Viridian Longbow - Can tap the commander and synergizes with deathtouch creatures</li> <li>Agony Warp -This can be used on one or two different creatures</li> <li>Cast Down</li> <li>Moment of Craving</li> <li>Grasp of Darkness - Don't forget that this can kill indestructible creatures</li> <li>Into the Roil - If you have infinite mana, this can be used to draw your deck (you will need an Archaeomancer type creature). Also, this gives our deck a way to deal with enchantments and artifacts.</li> <li>Victim of Night</li> <li>Executioner's Capsule</li> <li>Fall from Favor - This can also be placed on your own creatures if necessary</li> <li>Oubliette - When a commander phases out it does not go to the command zone</li> <li>Pestilence</li> </ul> </div> <h2>The Creatures</h2> <p><strong>“Bottom Feeders Sometimes Rise to the Top” - Source Unknown</strong></p> <p>As was said above, this is a creature-based control deck. The deck leans on its creatures for card advantage, synergy with flicker effects, and for blockers. The list below includes each creature and a brief summary of why it is in the deck:</p> <div class=\"indent\"> <ul> <li>Tidehollow Strix - A simple deathtouch flying blocker can be very useful. Synergizes with Viridian Longbow.</li> <li>Bone Picker - This often costs one and has deathtouch synergy as discussed above.</li> <li>Cadaver Imp - Can return from graveyard to hand other ETB creatures and combo pieces when needed.</li> <li>Chittering Rats - Can be used as a generic discard spell or as a game ending lock later, (Flicker Chittering Rats and an Archaeomancer effect every draw step to lock the opponent out of ever seeing a new card again)</li> <li>Crypt Rats - One of the only wraths in the format</li> <li>Fleshbag Marauder - A three drop edict that can also block well or attack decent damage</li> <li>Liliana's Specter - Another discard spell that is also a flying blocker/attacker</li> <li>Man-o'-War - A generic bounce spell when things need to slow down</li> <li>Vampire Spawn - Can be an alternate win-con without infinite mana</li> <li>Sea Gate Oracle - Selective card draw (Can also be flickered with an Archaeomancer effect to draw repeatedly)</li> <li>Trinket Mage - Discussed above</li> <li>Archaeomancer - A key combo piece and important synergy piece to the whole deck</li> <li>Thorn of the Black Rose - Deathtouch (see Longbow) and card advantage</li> <li>Gray Merchant of Asphodel - Can be an alternate win-con without infinite mana</li> <li>Mnemonic Wall - Additional Archaeomancer effect</li> <li>Mulldrifter - Fairly costed card draw that can also be a creature in the late game</li> <li>Peregrine Drake - Key combo piece (see below for details)</li> <li>Salvager of Secrets - Additional Archaeomancer effect</li> </ul> </div> <h2>The Graveyard is Your Friend and Other Good-Stuff</h2> <p><strong>“Birth and death are both reversible” - Nicol Bolas</strong></p> <p>Between all of the control pieces and ETB creatures is the “good stuff”. These are the nearly-auto-includes that most UB control decks will want to play. We have our powerful cantrips in Ponder and Preordain, draw spells like Sign in Blood, Forbidden Alchemy, Dihada's Ploy and Night's Whisper, and the absolutely devastating discard spell; Hymn to Tourach.</p> <p>Additionally, since we are discarding cards into our graveyard, we want to take advantage of this resource and not let it go to waste. Cards like Mystic Sanctuary, Cadaver Imp, Unearth and Omen of the Dead give us access to the creatures that make it to the bin, and Archaeomancer, Salvager of Secrets and Mnemonic Wall can pick up spells.</p> <p>There are a few other great cards that don't fit anywhere else. Tidehollow Strix is a solid blocker that can trip up decks like Slippery Bogle on turn two, and Thorn of the Black Rose can be a recurring draw spell and a frustrating wall. Both of these cards also have deathtouch which synergizes well with Viridian Longbow.</p> <h2>A Combo</h2> <p><strong>“Sometimes it is useful to take a break from existence” - Source Unknown</strong></p> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/2/d/2d0e3b84-31ea-4ff2-8028-1e983fad22d4.jpg?1580014063\" alt=\"Peregrine Drake\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>By this point, you have seen all of the combo pieces but let's review. The deck sometimes wins via the standard Peregrine Drake combo. The combo goes like this:</p> <div class=\"indent\"> <ul> <li>Have a Archaeomancer / Salvager of Secrets / Mnemonic Wall in play (if you play it the turn of the combo you will need a total of 7 mana available if you play it a turn early you will need just 5)</li> <li>Play Peregrine Drake and untap 5 lands.</li> <li>Play Ghostly Flicker or Displace (These can be in the bin at the start of the turn and picked up by Archaeomancer the turn of the combo, so don't be afraid to discard them or use them early in the game).</li> <li>The flicker targets the Archaeomancer and the Drake. When the Archaeomancer returns it targets the Ghostly Flicker and when the Drake returns you untap 5 lands.</li> <li>Float 5 mana and repeat.</li> </ul> </div> <p>Now you have infinite mana, but what to do with it? Well, there are a few routes you can take from here. Remember, the cards you need for the mana outlet may be in the graveyard, but you can pick them up with the Archaeomancer by using the last flicker to target a finisher piece instead of the Ghostly Flicker.</p> <div class=\"indent\"> <ul> <li>Use Into the Roil with kicker to bounce and replay the Archaeomancer to draw your deck. (Find Grey Merchant of Asphodel or Vampire Spawn to win)</li> <li>Flicker the Archaeomancer and Grey Merchant of Asphodel or Vampire Spawn to drain the opponent.</li> <li>Flicker the Archaeomancer and Mulldrifter / Sea Gate Oracle to draw your deck. (Find Grey Merchant of Asphodel to win)</li> <li>Use Archaeomancer plus Salvager of Secrets and Fungal Infection to create infinite tokens (target the Archaeomancer each time)</li> <li>Use Archaeomancer plus Mnemonic Wall and Moment of Craving to gain infinite life (target the Mnemonic Wall each time)</li> </ul> </div> <p>So now we know how the combo works, but how to we find the pieces when we are in a pinch? One of the biggest weaknesses of the combo is that the key pieces cost 3, 4, and 5. The commander can tutor for them, but only if we have the same CMC card in our hand. But we don't want to play a lot of 5 drops to bog down the deck. So, what do we do?</p> <p>This is where tutors and alternate costs come into play. Remember I said that I would talk about Gush later? Gush is a very important card in the deck. It has a CMC of 5 but it often is cast of 0. This keeps it from bogging us down. And, more importantly, it can be tutored for by both Merchant Scroll and Mystical Teachings. This gives us a few more ways to find a 5 drop when we need one. If you are working up to the combo, a few turns out you can even use Muddle the Mixture or Shred Memory or the commander's ability to get Merchant Scroll.</p> <p>Bone Picker should be mentioned here as well. Even though the card is very good on its own. It also is a 4 drop that is often cast for 1. This lets us find Archaeomancer with our commander's ability when we need to. Mulldrifter too has an alternate casting cost. It is 5 CMC but can be cast for its Evoke cost at 3 as a Divination. The flying fish can be discarded to go find Peregrine Drake or even a Salvager of Secrets later on. I want to mention here that Ghostly Flicker and Displace are the two best cards in the deck because they synergize with almost every creature we have. But, don't be afraid to use them for random value or to save a creature from removal. You can always get them back later with Archaeomancer creatures.</p> <h2>The Toolbox</h2> <p><strong>“The finest minions know what I need without me ever saying a thing” - Liliana Vess</strong></p> <p>Briefly, I want to talk about how to build a tutoring toolbox for Disciple of Deceit. The key to the smooth function of the deck is having access to the effect you want at multiple CMC values. I have included some examples below:</p> <div class=\"indent\"> <ul> <li>Targeted Removal: 1 CMC = Disfigure, 2 CMC = Cast Down, 3 CMC Oubliette</li> <li>Edicts: 1 CMC = Curfew, 2 CMC = Chainer's Edict, 3 CMC = Fleshbag Marauder</li> <li>Bounce: 1 CMC = Curfew, 2 CMC = Into the Roil, 3 CMC = Man-O-War</li> <li>Counterspell: 2 CMC = Counterspell, 3 CMC = Soul Manipulation</li> <li>Draw Spell: 1 CMC = Preordain, 2 CMC = Sign in Blood, 3 CMC = Forbidden Alchemy, 4 CMC = Thorn of the Black Rose, 5 CMC = Mulldrifter</li> <li>Recursion: 1 CMC = Unearth, 3 CMC = Cadaver Imp, 4 CMC = Archaeomancer, 5 CMC = Salvager of Secrets</li> <li>Wrath: 2 CMC = Nausea, 3 CMC = Crypt Rats, 4 CMC = Pestilence</li> <li>Discard: 2 CMC = Hymn to Tourach, 3 CMC = Chittering Rats</li> <li>Life gain: 2 CMC = Moment of Craving, 3 CMC = Vampire Spawn, 5 CMC = Gray Merchant of Asphodel</li> </ul> </div> <img src=\"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/d/4/d4133ceb-6176-411a-9eb8-51721c1bb435.jpg?1617433102\" alt=\"Merchant Scroll\" class=\"card\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p>Another toolbox that you may want to think about is Merchant Scroll. Scroll can only get a blue instant. This sounds restrictive but it actually allows you to access a lot of effects. For example, looking at the above list:</p> <div class=\"indent\"> <ul> <li>Targeted Removal: Agony Warp</li> <li>Edicts: Curfew</li> <li>Bounce: Into the Roil</li> <li>Counterspell: Deprive</li> <li>Draw Spell: Gush</li> <li>Recursion: Soul Manipulation</li> <li>Wrath: None</li> <li>Discard: None</li> <li>Life gain: Dihada's Ploy</li> </ul> </div> <h2>The Lands and Some Closing Thoughts</h2> <p><strong>“Long after the land has given up the last of its secrets, there will still be mysteries in the depths of the sea” - Kiora</strong></p> <p>The deck plays 39 lands. I know this may come as a shock to the multiplayer people, but when you don't have any mana rocks, you need to play more lands. Honestly, 39 might be low. Think about it this way. In standard, a control deck plays about 25-27 lands. This would equate to 41 to 45 lands in a 99-card deck. Now, we have a lower curve then some standard decks, but 39 is the lowest I would go for two-color control.</p> <p>There are 26 untapped color sources and 10 tapped lands that can produce or tutor both colors. I have chosen to include a few utility lands. These are Quicksand, Desert, Mystic Sanctuary and Bojuka Bog. These are sometimes controversial, but they can be very useful in the right situation. Feel free to go without if you don't want them. (Remember that Gush and Deprive can bounce a Mystic Sanctuary back to hand and Ghostly Flicker can trigger it as well). It is likely that only the devoted have made it this far in the article, so thank you for reading! This is <a href=\"https://www.moxfield.com/decks/woVDZkcoykWy69MaMIiuZQ\" target=\"_blank\">the decklist</a>. Feel free to copy it card for card or change whatever you like.</p> <p>The deck is fun. It is challenging. When you are playing it, you are forced to think several turns ahead so that you know what to tutor for. I make a lot of mistakes piloting it but I enjoy it more than any of my other decks. If that isn't an endorsement, I don't know what is. Hopefully you enjoyed this in-depth look at Disciple of Deceit. If you have any questions, you can find me on Discord!</p>"
