Living close to Channel Fireball (the old location downtown), I left Standard behind and began grinding Modern events and regional championships. I've played competitive commander from the moment I opened the Heavenly Inferno Precon in 2011 and was on the development team for the first cEDH-viable Kaalia of the Vast list. I am an active member in both the Competitive Commander (cEDH) and Competitive Pauper Commander (cPDH) scenes."

Any given night I find myself brewing for PDH, cPDH, AND PDC! I help maintain the Pauper Commander legality on Scryfall and I'm a member of the cPDH Deck Database committee. You can also find me with The Hexdrinkers Podcast or on Twitter! My favorite deck is either Azra Oddsmaker or Duskmantle Guildmage/Persistent Petitioners. Grixis FTW."

Most of my pet cards break the color pie. As a player, I want everyone at the table to have fun. Unless you kill my Scaretiller."

I am one of the original writers at PDH Home Base, mostly known for, if anything, wasting my time developing hyper-aggressive and mid-range strategies for a 75%+ deckbuilding environment. Due to my inability to maintain any semblance of a writing schedule, my primary focus now is to maintain the integrity of the format and keep things as healthy as possible. My past, current, and future favorite PDH deck is Thunderscape Battlemage."

I've got a lot of favorite decks so I won't try to list them here, but the general theme is: I like all-in decks that do things much more than decks that prevent your opponents from doing anything. I play a lot of Red and do not regret it."

I've started brewing competitive PDH decks in 2018/2019 and always tried to break the format. I'd rather work on a deck for months and months to make it as smooth and tight as possible, than build several decks without deeper work on them. My love to archetypes doesnt know any borders. I like some beatdown in formats that allow it, I like some hard control in formats that allow it and I like some combo in formats that allow it. Im probably just a spike that always seeks to understand what works best where and why."
